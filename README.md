# Project Description
Due to Covid-19, the topic of sustianbility has been badly neglected and so our webapp, "Sustabilize" will solve the lack of public knowledge on sustainablity by providing a metric to individual users on their personal sustainblity as a percentage.

Covid-19 has allowed us to slow down and reflect on our current state of the world. According to Nature, global carbon emission has declined by 8% in 2020 due to covid. However, global emissions are on the rise once again in 2021. Furthermore, covid has created its own problems such as the large-scale dumping of plastic products into the sea, with over 129 million face masks and 65 billion gloves getting dumped into the ocean each month. These plastic products can release greenhouse gasses such as methane and ethylene when hit by sunlight, further accelerating global warming. While global emission may of have temporarily decreased, there is no doubt that these accumulated wastes will cause an even bigger problem in the future.

It is the role of our generation to create a beautiful, sustainable world for our future generations. We must come to the realization that there is no point in pursuting short term economic growth if our future is a dead end. More importantly, to achieve this goal of a sustainable future, we must educate ourselves and realize the impact we create with our daily activities. The collective contribution of billions of educated people is the key to achieving global sustainability. 

Our app is designed to calculate and track an individual's carbon footprint. By calculating the carbon footprint, we get to realize how big of an impact our actions are on the environment, and by tracking the footprint, the individual is able to see their own progress and realize that this is not an impossible problem to solve. Although some of us may of have given up on achieving net 0 emissions by 2030, we hope that by trying out our app, they can realize that this problem can be adressed through genuine effort and small steps. 

Our app also provides realistic solutions to reduce the footprint of each sector according to the user inputs. We hope that this feature will help jumpstart the actions of individuals that are stuck on finding ways to reduce their carbon footprint.





# Simple description of what your project is and what it does:
This project allows for calculation, tracking, and education of individual's sustainability through a web app. 
Its purpose is to get individuals to be more concious about their carbon footprint and to promote changes toward zero emission and overall sustainability.
Individuals can click the link on the top left to measure their footprint, and get a detailed statistics in the home page.
